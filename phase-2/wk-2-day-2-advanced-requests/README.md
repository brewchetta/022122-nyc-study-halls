# Study Hall - React Day 7
## Advanced Requests

## Learning goals
- POST, PATCH, DELETE request in React


## Before lecture try to...

- Set up the `planets` state so that it gets fetched from the `db.json` when the app starts

- Make it so that when a user clicks a planet in the list, it fetches that individual planet information from the server and populates `PlanetDetail`

- Hook up the `PlanetForm` component so that when a user submits the form, a new planet gets created and added to the list (both in the `db.json` and on the client side)

- When a user toggles the `Change Planet Status` button, the change persists on both the client side and the `db.json`

- When a user clicks the `Remove Planet` button, it removes the planet both from the client side and the `db.json`

## HW:
- Your choice of code challenge practice
